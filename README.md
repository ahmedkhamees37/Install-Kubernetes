# 🚀 Kubernetes Installation Using Kubeadm and Flannel with Worker Node Integration

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on setting up a **Kubernetes** cluster! 🎉 We will walk through the process of installing Kubernetes on two Ubuntu virtual machines (VMs), using **Kubeadm** for the setup and **Flannel** as the networking solution. Additionally, you'll deploy a simple **Nginx** application to verify the installation. As a bonus, we will also set up a **K3s** lightweight Kubernetes cluster! 💡

## 🔧 Step 1: Create Two Ubuntu Virtual Machines

Ensure you have two **Ubuntu 20.04** VMs with fresh installations. Once the system is ready, run the following commands to update your system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
